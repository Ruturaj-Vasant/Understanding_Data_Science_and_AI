You can take a look at the chapters: Preliminaries, Introductory Examples (e.g. \"Counting Time Zones with pandas”), IPython (page 46 to 62) and specially, Pandas--one of the main Python packages for data analysis.  We will work with Pandas in class.\n","- [Pandas Cookbook](https://www.amazon.com/Pandas-Cookbook-Scientific-Computing-Visualization/dp/1784393878) is another great resource to learn Pandas. It has lots of practice problems with detailed solutions in IPython notebooks.\n"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.5"},"colab":{"provenance":[{"file_id":"1kTX0fD4zy1yn1jhTQ5gh-IopQRT1gBEi","timestamp":1758149295226},{"file_id":"1bS71eadLWQIK8jYJtmHMSvXdiXuSgWRe","timestamp":1721933580630},{"file_id":"1jTZkOLmkE_911vNwIGqh_KHhtRWtIcAa","timestamp":1721933372547}]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
