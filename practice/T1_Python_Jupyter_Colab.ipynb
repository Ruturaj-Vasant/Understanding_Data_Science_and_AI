Stakeholders in companies in different industries and of various sizes consistently choose Python as the most flexible and powerful option. If you are going to learn one programming language, Python is a great choice.\n","\n","Additionally, Python benefits from a modular form which allows access to many libraries that enhance the core functionality of the language.   We will be using some of these core libraries, such as:\n","\n","* `numpy` - for basic mathematical functions\n","* `pandas` - for data science structures\n","* `scikitlearn` - for predictive modelling\n","* `matplotlib` - for data visualization\n","\n","and many others.\n","\n","\n","For this class we assume that you are coming in with basic programming skills and knowledge of core Python, including concepts of variable types, creating functions, conditionals, and looping.  \n","\n","Please review the notebook [PythonBasics.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kTX0fD4zy1yn1jhTQ5gh-IopQRT1gBEi) to review some of these core programming concepts  - you should be comfortable with all of this material at the start of class.  We will not be teaching these concepts, so if you are not familiar with the content of that notebook, you should consider taking an Intro to Programming class as a prerequisite.\n","\n","If you need to upskill on Python, there are many good YouTube videos and tutorials available on the web.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"collapsed":true,"id":"us6FTparR9Ac"},"source":["## Jupyter Notebooks\n","\n","The main way data scientists use Python is through _Jupyter Notebooks_ (formerly called iPython notebooks).  It is an interactive computational environment, in which you can combine code execution, rich text, mathematics, plots and rich media.   Notebooks are great because the code lives side by side with commentary, descriptions, and visualizations, and allows the data scientist to create a document for others to walk through, and execute, the code.\n","\n","The notebook form is a great way to code.  It separates code into *cells* where each cell can contain a functional chunk of code, and can be executed separately.  Notebook cells allow you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations.  Documentation lives side by side with the code in text cells using `markdown`, a special syntax to make communication easy.  \n","\n","Jupyter Notebooks have support for over 40 programming languages, including those popular in Data Science such as Python and R.  We will be using Python exclusively for our examples in this class, but feel free to program in other languages if you know them.

In this class, we will be using **Google Colab**, a cloud-based IDE that has many good features.   The best feature of Colab for the purpose of the class is that NYU provides the environment, compute and storage for Colab, so you dont have to provide this yourself.

The main difference is these run _locally_, on your machine, and not in the cloud, so you are responsible for the compute and storage.
